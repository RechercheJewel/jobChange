Summary:
A simple class mod! By equipping different tribal charms, other charms are amplified and powered up, as well as setting different effects. Very much work in progress, feel free to make suggestions for things you'd like to see.

Dependencies:
Modcommon
SFcore

Currently working:
Names.
Descs.
Player starts with them on new game.
Images for 4/6, 2 placeholders.
When 2+ class charms are equipped, player is considered overloaded.

TBA:
Increasing costs of certain charms for different tribes.
Fixing the charm notch bug.
Assorted 'in progress' for each tribe.

Known bugs:
When equipping a class charm and adding/removing charms that are altered by said class charm, the costs can get messed up. Please ensure that class charms are equipped before adding/removing any charms that have their costs altered by them.
Equipping multiple charms may break things. I'm not sure, it wasn't really designed for that.
